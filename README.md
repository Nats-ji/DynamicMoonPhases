# DynamicMoonPhases
Change the moon phase in Cyberpunk 2077 according to the real-world moon phases.

## Introduction
The moon phase inside the game will change accordingly with the moon phases in the real world, adding some dynamics to Cyberpunk2077's boring static environment.

## Install

*   Use vortex
*   Or just unpack the archive to the game root directory.

This mod requires an asi loader to work. If you don't know what is an asi load, just install [Cyber Engine Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/107). It ships with an asi loader.
